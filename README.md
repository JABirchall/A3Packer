![app](https://imglnx.com/i/be97.png)

# How to use
- Simply download a **[release](https://github.com/trdwll/A3Packer/releases)** and run the tool
- Select '*configure*' and fill in your info
- Once the app has been configured you can proceed to select a mission folder that you want to either Pack or Obfuscate

# Why?
*tl;dr laziness* - Well, I get tired of either writing batch, right clicking to pbo a mission, or having to rewrite the same cmd in terminal.

# Requirements
- [.Net Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48130)
- [PBO Manager](http://www.armaholic.com/page.php?id=16369)

# TODO
- Implement usage of other PBO tools
- New App Icon? Lol
- idk
